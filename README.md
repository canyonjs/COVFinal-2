# COVFinal-2
Final project for CMS120 at Rollins College.

Python script that pulls latest OurWorldInData COVID-19 data, parses it and visualizes that data according to user defined parameters using Matplotlib

Script allows you to generate a week or month graph for any country and metric present in OWID csv dataset.

5/12 Note: Repl.it's new project showcase format broke something
See the repl.it here: https://repl.it/@cjshaps/COVFinal-2 (May need to login to repl.it, strange bug with modules not loading when viewing repl.it as a guest)
