1. Lists the people who worked on this project:

Canyon Shapiro, Steph Valladares

2. Give a one-two paragraph explanation of your program.  Be specific! How does a user interact with your program?  What files does it read? What does the output mean?  Focus on what the program **does**, not how the code does it.

The program allows a user to query a dataset of COVID-19 statistics provided by the organization OurWorldInData via a command line python script. The program is supplied the dataset in the form of a .csv file, which is read and parsed according to user specified values. The user is asked to make three decisions in order to query the dataset: 1) Specify the country or ISO Code 2) Specify a range of time and 3) Identify the particular metric you wish to visualize (ex: new_cases, new_deaths). The program takes this input from the user and uses it to extract relevant information from the dataset and graph that information using matplotlib to be output as a png file.

3. Reflect on the project in one-two paragraphs.  What about it was challenging for you/your partner?  What part did you enjoy the most?  If you had more time/money/knowledge, what would you like to change or add to your project?

4. Approximately how much time did you spend on this project (collectively if you worked as a pair)?

20-30 Hours

5. For each of the following skills, list the line numbers in your final submission which correspond to the code demonstrating these skills.  You do not need to document **every** instance.  For example, if you have 8 `if` statements in your code, just list the line numbers for 1-2 of them.

| Skill  | Line numbers  |
|----|---|
|Functions|   |
|Conditional Logic|   |
|Repetition/Loops|   | 
|Lists or dictionaries| |
|User or file input | | 
|Advanced feature (change to be the name or description of your feature)|  |
